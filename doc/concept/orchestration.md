# Orchestration

Orchestration is the process of managing and coordinating the execution of multiple transactions.
It is a key concept in ProjectOrigin, as it allows for the creation of complex transactions that involve multiple registries.





Some transactions like [claim](../granular-certificates/transactions/claim.md)
does span multiple registries, but are performed as a distributed transaction using a saga pattern.
