# Federated network

Project-Origin chose to go with a federated network to ensure that the network as to ensure
that a network can be governed by a group of entities, which can ensure in follows current law and legislation.

A network of registries is a federated network, where each registry is a node in the network.

A federated network is governed by an authority or group,
where the current group is [Energy Track and Trace](https://github.com/Energy-Track-and-Trace),
which are defining a set of rules that apply for the electricy GCs and which rules apply to be part of the network.

All these rules are defined **must** be defined as software and will be enforced by the nodes in the network.
