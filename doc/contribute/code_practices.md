# Best practices

- All code must be `througly tested with automated test` run in the pipeline and locally.
- Manual test are `NOT` a test, verifies nothing and are of no value.
- The code is `sufficiently tested` when a developer are confident that their code will work as expected without manual testing.
- All code must be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged.
- All projects must be able to be built and tested locally with a single command (make file).
- All projects must have a pipeline that builds, tests and releases the project.
